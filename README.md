# Fast React Pizza Co. React.JS Project
<br>
This is the fist project in the advanced React Course, in which I am currently enrolled in. It is a simple app which shows a pizza place menu. Take a look at the code and let me know what you think.

## About the project
<br>
This menu of pizza's utilizes JSX within components to render a list of menu items. The origin of the menu items comes from an array of objects, in which I had to loop over to render the list. The list had multiple components which needed to be rendered. To do so, I had to utilize "props" or object properties, which were passed through the function, and displayed by the render. After the List was rendered, I utilized conditional statements, specifically the ternary operator, to render CSS styling, based off of an object property.

## Other than the Menu
<br>
I had the parent app component, which consisted of multiple child components, such as the header, menu, and footer. Some of these childe components, like the menu and footer, then consisted of another nested child component, called pizza or order, which rendered out the display of the individual pizza or the conditional statements letting the user know if the company was closed or open. Each pizza was then rendered by the parent list, which was how I obtained this semi-dynamic app.

## Thoughts
<br>
I very much enjoy React, as it allows me to nest components and clean up code. I have found with vanilla JS, code gets muddy and hard to understand due to the sheer amount that you have to write. Components make life easy as it easily contains data, JS logic, and JSX, which ultimately renders our "display".
